Case Study: Customer Churn Prediction 

Background:
A leading telecommunications company, is facing a significant challenge with customer churn. The company has been experiencing a high rate of customer attrition, leading to revenue loss and a decline in market share. To address this issue, it wants to implement a machine learning solution for predicting customer churn.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. By proactively identifying at-risk customers, the company aims to implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Data Description:
The dataset contains historical customer data including demographic information, service usage, account information, churn status etc. 

The dataset is labeled, with churn status as the target variable (binary: churned or not churned).

Tasks:
* Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
* Feature Importance Analysis
* Model Selection and Evaluation

Deliverables:
* Jupyter Notebook documenting the end-to-end process (Note: Code should carry the relevant comments, wherever required)
* Presentation summarising key findings, insights, and recommendations

Evaluation Criteria:
Candidates will be evaluated based on their ability to:
* Understand and interpret the dataset.
* Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering effectively.
* Select appropriate machine learning algorithms and tune hyper-parameters.
* Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
* Provide actionable insights.
